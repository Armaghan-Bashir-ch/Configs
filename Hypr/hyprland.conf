# Story, instructions, bind meanings, and others:

# When I first heard about Arch and Linux in general I was reluctant to installing and running it, becuase of the claims that it was overwhelmingly difficult to install, configure, and maintain. So I had though about it but had always decided not to do it, but one night I started digging a bit to learn about Arch more, and I found some coolsetups that I really wanted to have, so I determined that I want to install it, but again I was too lazy to do anything, and being in that lazy zone made me not install it for the next 4 months. But then one day I accidently hitmy wrist on my laptop, and it shutdown, when I rebooted it I found out that it's Hard drive and blown up, and I amso glad that it did! Becuase I can finnally get a new SSD, get rid of my excuses (since I did NOT want to set up  windows again from scarch, because it is a pain). So I did what I should have done months ago, installed the iso  file, burned it into my USB, booted inside, by taking a 3 page long note, installed it via "archinstall", which   is considered the _easy_ way of installing it, though I will try the manual one, sometime as well, it took about 2hours to install it, because of my internet being so slow, despite it being connected to an enthernet cable. Sure enough after hours of wait it was installed, I restarted my laptop, typed in my password, in what felt like a     retro-future lock screen, and I was not happy by what I first saw, because what ever I did, nothing happened, I   had of course known that there was kitty and I had to press SUPER+Q to open it, but that was doing nothing, waitedfor about 20+ minutes, before pressing WINDOWS+R and opening the default $menu/launcher, which was wofi, I opened wofi, and was relived, and installed firefox, and searched for how to connect to the internet, but I couldn't do  it despite trying by myself for 45+ minutes, then I had to took some help from my bro, he tried and tried for 2   hours, I think, but nothing changed, we tried enabling wifi but couldn't get networks to show and connect to any  of them, but it was around 12:00AM at the night, and I had to go home and sleep, but the internet was still not   connected, I woke up the next morning, connected to my home wifi via the ethernet cable, and fixed the problem    with in 5 minutes (so turns out sleeping for 11 hours does help) turns out the problem in-fact was that I did not have Network-Manager was not installed, installed it enabled it and connected to the internet wirelessly, and wentabout my things from that point on.

# The first section of this code "SETTING UP ALIASES FOR PROGRAMS I USUALLY USE" is mainly where I have alised andmade the names of the normal programs easier, example $browser for firefox, and it also looks fancy.

# The second section of this code "Monitors/cursors" is where I have setup my mouse cursors and Monitor screen    layouts. Cursor is Bibata-Modern-Ice, and size is 24px.

# The Third section of this code "All of my Animations" is where I have setup my animations, I have slide and fadefor workspace changes, and 8ms delay between them. Input, sens = 0.5, is where I have set my mouse cursor sens to 0.5. General is where I have set my app border colors, roundness, the ins and outs for the border and app, and    border size. Blur is where I have set my blurness amount, noice amount, size, and smoothness. And overall everthin-g related to styling of a window.

# All of my binds explained, "$mainMod" is my SUPER/WINDOWS key, I have, to be added .......
