# Why Arch or Hyprland?

For me I think the biggest thing I like about Arch is that it has a great community, I mean they would say "I use Arch btw" wherever they go, but I mean, just go and look any problem you are having right now up and you will find an answer, and in some rare casses that you do not find any answers, just ask yourself to reddit or stackoverflow, you would just help the community get even better, and also will get your answer.

Second thing is the Yay (AUR) package manager, yay is the hands down the greatest package manager ever, anything related to Arch, that is not trademarked can be installed, you can update the packages so easily with **pacman** which I also love. And its so easyy just know the package name type: `yay -S (Package name)` and it just installes, boom!, I don't have to open my browser open a new tab, search for it, download a file, and then click on the file to install it, I **don't want to or _need_ to do that**.
