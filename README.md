# Why Arch or Hyprland?

For me I think the biggest thing I like about Arch is that it has a great community, I mean they would say "I use Arch btw" wherever they go, but I mean, just go and look up any problem you are having right now up and you will find an answer, and in some rare casses that you do not find any answers, just ask yourself to reddit or stackoverflow, you would just help the community get even better, and also will get your answer.

Second thing is the Yay (AUR) package manager, yay is the hands down the greatest package manager ever, anything related to Arch, that is not trademarked can be installed, you can update the packages so easily with **pacman** which I also love. And its so easyy just know the package name type: `yay -S (Package name)` and it just installes, boom!, I don't have to open my browser open a new tab, search for it, download a file, and then click on the file to install it, I **don't want to or _need_ to do that**.

Third thing is the updating system, just one command: `sudo pacman -Syu`, and this will go through all the packages installed and upadate them, sometimes I had problem that something was wrong with pipewire, it was making pop noises, but I updated it one time using this command and everything was fixed, I have not had the problem ever since.



4th and final thing is of course how custamizable Hyprland really is, and its not about the Desktop Envirement, because Gnome gets pre-built with applications, and I don't know much about KDE Plasma, but it will be the same thing. The thing about Hyprland is that you get to mkae it YOU, how YOU like it, how YOU want it, you don't have to live in a desktop that some other service has chosen for you. When you open Hyprland you get 100% nothing, litteryly apart from the default "Hyprland wallpaper" nothing is visible, no taskbar, no wigets no time, no nothing, you have to open kitty (which is the worst thing in the entire world) and open `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` with nvim (of course), if you still you use VS code in this day and age, you might need help. You get to custamize how animations look and feel, their duration, what speed the wallpapers launch, you get to make each app as you want to make it, you get to create your own status bar (waybar) exactly how you like it, and I am not even at the top of the iceberg when it comes to custamization, there is so much, that you can spend you entire lifetime and still not be able to custamize everything you can do.

5th thing is obviously that you get to say "i use arch (btw)"
