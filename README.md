A minimal but decent chunck of these dotfiles has been taken from the internet, and I have done my best to credit them here, so here are all the credits I could find (in case I missed your credit: All credits go to their respective owners/creators/mainters):

Neovim config (my bro): https://github.com/itse4elhaam                                                                                                        
cava config: https://github.com/AlphaTechnolog/dotfiles                                                                                                       
fastfetch: https://github.com/ad1822/hyprdots

Now to the real business:


These are my dotfiles I use daily in my workflow on Arch Linux Hypr/Wayland, these include apps like: Ghostty Cava fast/neofetch and more.

Clone the repo if you want to:

```git clone https://github.com/Armaghan-Bashir-ch/dotfiles/ ~/.config```

**⚠️ Caution:**
make sure to run this command before cloning, this will help you get the same setup as me, or install the things that you may use the most:

sudo pacman/ yay  ``` -Q ghostty alacritty cava waybar fastfetch neofetch nvim rofi git wget curl spotify sddm tmux waybar zsh hyprland yay peru npm pipe sddm swaylock-fancy swaylock obsidian cmake btop```

Clone pklevel10k

```git clone git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/.config/zsh/themes/powerlevel10k```

Install the things that are not installed, OH MY ZSH is not required

If you use the hyprland.conf or the binds make sure to upadate them every once in a while :)
